# Q1 End of Lessons Reflection - Leonella Agnelly E. Pauig, 9-Magnesium

> List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. Java Script's basic statements - I understood this lesson immediately while it was being thought because the statements' names correspond to their function. I didn't need to memorize a long fancy code just to get my text to appear on an alert window or my button to appear on the website itself.
2. Control statements - The control statements of JS are incredibly identical to the control statements of C++, so I was able to get the lesson immediately. This lesson was basically just a review lesson for me.
3. Variable Declaration - This lesson was very simple for me because it just focused on the different uses for each variable delcaration type. The exercises and graded assesments we did this quarter also helped me broaden my understanding for each type of variable declaration.
4. Java Script Operations - Again, this lesson was easy for me because it was extremely identical to C++. I did have a hard time initially at comparison operators, but I was able to understand it soon enough as it kept getting reused and mentioned in lessons.
5. Loop Control Structures - I really liked loops during eight grade, so this lesson was pretty basic to me. This lesson was also taught to us properly and in an engaging manner.

> List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. Number Methods - I get the concept of Number Methods and how they can be used in coding, but the thing is I didn't and still haven't mastered them all. I know what some of the methods do and are like Number() and Parseint(), but I don't know how to use or know the rest. I may not be familiar with them because we never had an excercise that used them, or I may have just forgotten about them in the long run.
2. Functions - I know how functions work, I just confuse it a lot for C++ functions. They may look like the same thing, but sometimes when I make functions, I add a curly bracket to the end of the code for the "main function".
3. Loop Control Structures (break, nested loop, continue) - I understand the use of break, I'm just not used to the continue function that much. I'm also a bit ignorant when it comes to brackets, so nested loops are a bit of a hassle to me.
4. JS Overview and Syntax (external script) - I get how external scripts are used but I'm not really used to writing them on my codes. I have done so sometimes, but that's only because I thought they were the only ways to actually code at the time. I also want to know what src means.
5. Processing Function output - I just get lost if the function is just mentioned in a long line of code. I also get a bit lost if the function uses a lot of other stuff in it like Number methods and control loops for checking. It's not like I don't understand it, I just need to be exposed to it more so I can master it.

> Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

I'll try my best to self study if I have the time in the future so I won't have my brain fried when doing exercises. I'll also try my best to be less ignorant so I can avoid mistakes that'll cause me to head a specific lesson in the future.

> In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

I found the assesments, wether graded or non-graded, very helpful for they all exposed me to a mix of lessons and, in a way, helped me overcome my fear for them during exams. They also gave me a chance to apply what I've learned hands-on and see which parts of the lesson am I struggling on. I also found the kahoot games we'd have in class very helpful for they, just like the assesments, helped me check my understanding on each lesson better. So far there are no activities where I never learn anything from.
